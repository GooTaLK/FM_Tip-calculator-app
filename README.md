## My process

### Built with

For this challenge I decided not to use frameworks. I just made use of some typescript.
I also used pnpm as package manager, vite as bundler, so nesting and autoprefixer postcss plugins.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Bundler
- [Postcss-nesting](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugins/postcss-nesting) - Postcss plugin
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - Postcss plugin
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
